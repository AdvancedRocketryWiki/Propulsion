Math: Calculus I,II,III -> Differential Equations -> Linear Algebra -> Partial Diff. Eqns.

ThermoFluids: Thermodynamics -> Incompressible Flows -> Compressible Flows

Chemistry: AP-Chemistry or Gen. Chem. -> Combustion -> (Maybe Stat. Thermo or Physical Chemistry)

General Theory: Introductory Rocket Propulsion (Sutton/SPAAD) -> Advanced Rocket Propulsion

Experimental: [Generally too expensive to find a class that will teach you hands on experimental work, need to find a lab to work/internship/Rocketry club]

This is purely from a rocket engine standpoint. You still need structures, dynamics, kinematics, if you want to make something that flies.

This is what I recommend for people before they start trying to make liquid biprops. You can try stuff out with maybe 0% of the knowledge above, but you'll never really understand why stuff doesn't work or why it does work. You will have a hard time trying to understand the 60+years of work that other people have done
